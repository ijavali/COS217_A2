"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

The amount of work for this assignment was a lot compared to the 
content I actually learned/gained experience with. Learning about char arrays
and pointers in C was useful as well as linking c files, but at a certain point, the steps the assignment
required started to become excessive.
As in the previous assignment, it started off sort of fun to code the functions. 
It was not fun spending 25+ minutes to figure out that my code was not passing
the test cases because arr1[i] = arr2[i++] works differently in C than what I'm used to with 
Java and C++.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

Not aware of any bugs.

What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.
When I run "splint teststr.c stra.c", I do not get any warnings for stra.c

disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

It is not possible for these functions to verify if the destination memory area is of a sufficient size. 
All that these functions have been given as input are pointers to an address in memory where the array begins. 
There is no information passed about the length of the array.
